# Anguil

Anguils are a unique species of humanoids that possess distinct, eel-like features and abilities. They have elongated bodies similar to that of an eel. They have the ability to produce electric shocks, making them dangerous in battle. These electrifying shocks can stun or incapacitate their enemies, giving the Anguils an advantage in battle.

According to their myths, the gods of water and lightning created the Anguils. Legend has it that the ferocity and adaptability of the eel impressed the gods, and decided to imbue a humanoid species with some of these traits. They crafted the Anguils with sleek bodies and powerful muscles, giving them exceptional speed and agility in water. Additionally, they granted them the ability to generate electric shocks, which the Anguils could use for both defense and hunting.
