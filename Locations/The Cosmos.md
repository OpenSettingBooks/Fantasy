# The Cosmos

The cosmos is the place in which the setting takes place. It can be described as a sea on which leafs of the autmn trees can stay afloat. Those leafs drift on the currents of the sea and can either drift away from other leafs or collide with eachother. Sometimes those collisions cause the leafs to overlap each other which can wreak havoc on those who live on those leafs. 

One of those occurrence seems to be quite permanent and is the best explanation the _leafologists_, the name of scholars who dedicated their studies to the cosmos, came up with to explain the Fae Realm and its connection with the primary Realm.

Those following leafs are known in academic circles:

- The [[The Fae Realm|Fae Realm]]
- The [[The Primary Realm|Primary Realm]]
- The [[The Far Realm|Far Realm]]

But, there are certainly hundreds if not thousands other leafs, that float on the cosmic sea.
