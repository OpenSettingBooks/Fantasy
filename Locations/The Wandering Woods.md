# The Wandering Woods

The Wandering Woods is a forest at the edge of the human kingdoms. Its defining feature is the transformation of its trails during traversal, ensnaring explorers and unlucky merchants in endless journeys.

A prominent aspect of the forest's lore suggests that the Wandering Woods held an ancient pact with the fae, a bond woven into the very fabric of its existence. Believers claim that the trails can lead you in and out of the fae realm, though no one has returned to confirm this.
